# Stay Home for Nevada
A repository with messages in every programming language I know (and don't know) how to write "Stay home for Nevada", so that way no programmers are out spreading COVID-19
## Will it always be editablblblble?
No, once COVID-19 is declared *over* by the ***WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION***, the repository will be archived.
